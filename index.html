        383
        00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,076
        Do you make any money

        No! Stay where you are.

        00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:59,594
        It would hurt.
        I'm not saying it wouldn't.

        413
        00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,186
        To tell you the truth,
        I'm a lot more concerned ...

        414
        00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:04,345
        about that water being so cold.

                                    class the following night, along with several prominent first-class passengers -
                                    including the Countess of Rothes, Archibald Gracie (Bernard Fox), Thomas Andrews
                                    (Victor
                                    Garber), Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), and John Jacob Astor (Eric Braeden) & his wife.
                                    Jack
                                    and Rose develop a tentative friendship, though Cal and Ruth are wary of him.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Following
                                    dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class. During the party Cal's
                                    butler, Spicer Lovejoy (David Warner) stealthily sneaks down the third class
                                    staircase
                                    to spy on her. After a very tense breakfast the following morning, in which Cal
                                    shows an
                                    inclination towards violence, Rose becomes even more apprehensive about her upcoming
                                    marriage. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve the DeWitt Bukaters'
                                    financial problems. After spotting Rose, Cal and Ruth out on the Boat Deck, Jack
                                    stealthily sneaks back into First Class and tries to warn Rose about what she may be
                                    facing. Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but later realizes that she prefers him over
                                    Cal.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    After meeting on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room and displays
                                    Cal's
                                    engagement present: the Heart of the Ocean. At her request, Jack sketches Rose
                                    posing
                                    nude wearing it. Meanwhile, in the First-Class Smoking Room, Cal's butler informs
                                    him
                                    that none of the stewards have seen Rose at all that night. Cal orders the butler to
                                    find her. Rose & Jack manage to evade Cal's bodyguard and have sex in an automobile
                                    inside the cargo hold. They later visit the forward well deck, and while on it, the
                                    lookouts spot an iceberg directly in the ship's path.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Orders are given to turn the ship
                                    hard a-starboard and run the engines full astern, but the ship takes too long to
                                    make
                                    the turn and the starboard side scrapes along the iceberg, causing substantial
                                    damage to
                                    the watertight compartments, including the cargo hold where Jack & Rose had been
                                    having
                                    sex in the automobile. Jack & Rose witness the collision with the iceberg and
                                    overhear
                                    the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    On the bridge, builder Thomas
                                    Andrews, Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), the ship's officers and White Star Line
                                    Managing
                                    Director Bruce Ismay (Jonathan Hyde) discuss the damage. The water has reached 14
                                    feet
                                    above the keel in 10 minutes and has flooded 5 watertight compartments. Mr. Andrews
                                    warns that because of a design flaw, the water will spill over the tops of the
                                    bulkheads
                                    at E Deck, and this will cause the ship to sink. He gives an hour, two at most, for
                                    the
                                    ship to remain afloat.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and a mocking note from her
                                    in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to tell Cal of the
                                    collision, he has his butler slip the necklace into Jack's pocket and accuses him of
                                    theft. He is arrested, taken to the Master-at-arms' office, and handcuffed to a
                                    pipe.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket. With the ship sinking, Rose is
                                    desperate
                                    to free Jack. She flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and rescues
                                    him.
                                    They return to the boat deck, where Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat;
                                    Cal
                                    claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack
                                    the
                                    arrangement is only for himself.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave
                                    Jack and jumps back on board. Jack confronts her, angrily at first, but his angers
                                    soon
                                    turns to affection and they share a series of kisses at the bottom of the Grand
                                    Staircase. Cal, seeing this, takes his butler's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into
                                    the
                                    flooding first class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he
                                    gave
                                    his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Jack & Rose are forced to flee below
                                    decks to escape Cal, and narrowly escape drowning themselves. They become trapped
                                    behind
                                    a locked gate, but Jack manages to free them just as the rising water reaches their
                                    heads. Out on the Boat Deck, Cal decides to make his own escape. He reminds the
                                    First
                                    Officer of the arrangement made earlier, but the officer angrily turns on Cal and
                                    refuses to allow him boarding. When he spots a lost child hiding behind a winch, he
                                    takes the child and is subsequently allowed into a collapsible lifeboat by Chief
                                    Officer
                                    Wilde.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    As Cal and others board the collapsible, the water surges into the bridge &
                                    wheelhouse, drowning Captain E.J. Smith and causing Cal's boat to start floating off
                                    the
                                    deck. By now the stern is staring to rise out of the water and the remaining
                                    passengers
                                    are running farther & farther aft. After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose
                                    return
                                    to the boat deck.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    All the lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their
                                    deaths as the stern rises out of the water. Water now crashes through the huge dome
                                    over
                                    the Grand Staircase, drowning those passengers trapped inside. Jack & Rose reach the
                                    very stern - where they had first met - and take up positions on it by climbing over
                                    the
                                    rail, next to Chief Baker Charles Joughin.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    The ship breaks in half, causing the stern to
                                    crash down into the water and killing Lovejoy, the butler. As the bow breaks off it
                                    pulls the stern back into the air, leaving it sitting there for a minute. Jack and
                                    Rose
                                    ride it into the ocean as it fills with water and then plunges to the bottom.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    As Jack &
                                    Rose let go of the stern, the Titanic disappears into the darkness below them, and
                                    they
                                    both swim to the surface to find themselves in a massive mob of passengers and crew.
                                    Within minutes, Rose & Jack find a piece of paneling from the Grand Staircase, and
                                    he
                                    helps her onto the wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person. Holding the
                                    edge, he
                                    assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. He dies of hypothermia
                                    but
                                    she is saved when Fifth Officer Lowe & some crewmen return to try to find survivors.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the RMS Carpathia takes the survivors to New
                                    York.
                                    There she gives her name as Rose Dawson. She later learns that Cal committed suicide
                                    after losing everything in the 1929 Wall Street Crash.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Lovett abandons his search after
                                    hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of the Keldysh, Rose takes out the Heart of
                                    the
                                    Ocean - in her possession all along - and drops it into the sea over the wreck site.
                                    While she is seemingly asleep in her bed, photos on her dresser depict a life of
                                    freedom
                                    and adventure, partly inspired by Jack. A young Rose returns to the ship - at first,
                                    a
                                    gloomy wreck on the bottom - but as Rose reaches the Promenade Deck the ship begins
                                    to
                                    glow with light. As she enters the Grand Staircase she is greeted by those who
                                    perished
                                    on the ship - including the Titanic's band, First Officer Murdoch, Thomas Andrews,
                                    Jack's friends Fabrizio & Tommy Ryan, and standing at the clock is Jack himself. He
                                    extends a hand and they reunite, to the happy cheers of the perished passengers &
                                    crew.

        63 INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

        She enters the room. Stands in the middle, staring at her reflection in the
        large vanity mirror. Just stands there, then--
        
        With a primal, anguished cry she claws at her throat, ripping off her pearl
        necklace, which explodes across the room. In a frenzy she tears at herself,
        her clothes, her hair... then attacks the room. She flings everything off
        the dresser and it flies clattering against the wall. She hurls a
        handmirror against the vanity, cracking it.
        
                                            CUT TO:
        
        <span class="color-highlight">64 EXT. A DECK PROMENADE, AFT - NIGHT
        
        Rose runs along the B deck promenade. She is dishevelled, her hair flying.
        She is crying, her cheeks streaked with tears. But also angry, furious!
        Shaking with emotions she doesn't understand... hatred, self-hatred,
        desperation. A strolling couple watch her pass. Shocked at the emotional
        display in public.
        
                                            CUT TO:
        
        65 EXT. POOP DECK - NIGHT
        
        Jack is kicked back on one of the benches gazing at the stars blazing
        gloriously overhead. Thinking artist thoughts and smoking a cigarette.
        
        Hearing something, he turns as Rose runs up the stairs from the well deck.
        They are the only two on the stern deck, except for QUARTERMASTER ROWE,
        twenty feet above them on the docking bridge catwalk. She doesn't see Jack
        in the shadows, and runs right past him.
        
        TRACKING WITH ROSE as she runs across the deserted fantail. Her breath
        hitches in an occasional sob, which she suppresses. Rose slams against the
        base of the stern flagpole and clings there, panting. She stares out at the
        black water.
        
        Then starts to climb over the railing. She has to hitch her long dress way
        up, and climbing is clumsy. Moving methodically she turns her body and gets
        her heels on the white-painted gunwale, her back to the railing, facing out
        toward blackness. 60 feet below her, the massive propellers are churning
        the atlantin into white foam, and a ghostly wake trails off toward the
        horizon.
        
        IN A LOW ANGLE, we see Rose standing like a figurehead in reverse. Below
        her are the huge letters of the name "TITANIC".
        
        She leans out, her arms straightening... looking down hypnotized, into the
        vortex below her. Her dress and hair are lifted by the wind of the ship's
        movement. The only sound, above the rush of water below, is the flutter and
        snap of the big Union Jack right above her.
        
                            JACK
        
        Don't do it.
        
        She whips her head around at the sound of his voice. It takes a second for
        her eyes to focus.
        
                            ROSE
        
        Stay back! Don't come any closer!
        
        Jack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow from the stern
        running lights.
        
                            JACK
        
        Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
        
                            ROSE
        
        No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
        
                            JACK
        
        No you won't.
        
                            ROSE
        
        What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will
        not do. You don't know me.
        
                            JACK
        
        You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
        
        Rose is confused now. She can't see him very well through the tears, so she
        wipes them with one hand, almost losing her balance.
        
                            ROSE
        
        You're distracting me. Go away.
        
                            JACK
        
        I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
        
                            ROSE
        
        Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
        
        He takes off his jacket.
        
                            JACK
        
        I'm a good swimmer.
        
        He starts unlacing his left shoe.
        
                            ROSE
        
        The fall alone would kill you.
        
                            JACK
        
        It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more
        concerned about the water being so cold.
        
        She looks down. The reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in.
        
                            ROSE
        
        How cold?
        
                            JACK
        
                    (taking off his left shoe)
        
        Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
        
        He starts unlacing his right shoe.
        
                            JACK
        
        Ever been to Wisconsin?
        
                            ROSE
        
                        (perplexed)
        
        No.
        
                            JACK
        
        Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there,
        near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were
        ice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole in
        the--
        
                            ROSE
        
        I know what ice fishing is!
        
                            JACK
        
        Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through
        some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down
        there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't
        breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.
        
                    (takes off his other shoe)
        
        Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I
        said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over
        the rail and get me off the hook here.
        
                            ROSE
        
        You're crazy.
        
                            JACK
        
        That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one
        hanging off the back of a ship.
        
        He slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse.
        
                            JACK
        
        Come on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand.
        
        Rose stares at this madman for a long time. She looks at his eyes and they
        somehow suddenly seem to fill her universe.
        
                            ROSE
        
        Alright.
        
        She unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him. He
        reaches out to take it, firmly.
        
                            JACK
        
        I'm Jack Dawson.
        
                            ROSE
        
                            (voice quavering)
        
        Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
        
        Rose starts to turn. Now that she has decided to live, the height is
        terrifying. She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing, turning
        to face the ship. As she starts to climb, her dress gets in the way, and
        one foot slips off the edge of the deck.
        
        She plunges, letting out a piercing SHRIEK. Jack, gripping her hand, is
        jerked toward the rail. Rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand.
        
        QUARTERMASTER ROWE, up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads for
        the ladder.
        
                            ROSE
        
        HELP! HELP!!
        
                            JACK
        
        I've got you. I won't let go.
        
        Jack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself on the railing
        with his other hand. Rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smooth
        hull. Jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing. She can't get any
        footing in her dress and evening shoes, and she slips back. Rose SCREAMS
        again.
        
        Jack, awkwardly clutching Rose by whatever he can get a grip on as she
        flails, gets her over the railing. They fall together onto the deck in a
        tangled heap, spinning in such a way that Jack winds up slightly on top of
        her.
        
        Rowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like it's a fire drill
        and sprints across the fantail.</span>
        
                            ROWE
        
        Here, what's all this?!
        
        Rowe runs up and pulls Jack off of Rose, revealing her dishevelled and
        sobbing on the deck. Her dress is torn, and the hem is pushing up above her
        knees, showing one ripped stocking. He looks at Jack, the shaggy steerage
        man with his jacket off, and the first class lady clearly in distress, and
        starts drawing conclusions. Two seamen chug across the deck to join them.
        
                            ROWE
        
                            (to Jack)
        
        Here you, stand back! Don't move an inch!
        
                            (to the seamen)
        
        Fetch the Master at Arms.
        
                                            CUT TO:
        
        66 EXT. POOP DECK - NIGHT
        
        A few minutes later. Jack is being detained by the burly MASTER AT ARMS,
        the closest thing to a cop on board. He is handcuffing Jack. Cal is right
        in front of Jack, and furious. He has obviously just rushed out here with
        Lovejoy and another man, and none of them have coats over their black tie
        evening dress. The other man is COLONEL ARCHIBALD GRACIE, a mustachioed
        blowhard who still has his brandy snifter. He offers it to Rose, who is
        hunched over crying on a bench nearby, but she waves it away. Cal is more
        concerned with Jack. He grabs him by the lapels.
        
                            CAL
        
        What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me,
        you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
        
                            ROSE
        
        Cal, stop! It was an accident.
        
                            CAL
        
        An accident?!
        
                            ROSE
        
        It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
        
        Rose looks at Jack, getting eye contact.
        
                            ROSE
        
        I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I
        would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost
        went over himself.
        
                            CAL
        
        You wanted to see the propellers?
